Pug Race
=========


## Intro
Pug Race is the first pug racing videogame, strongly inspired by the old school horse racing game in theme parks.


## Rules
* First, create your pug
* Then, join a game or create yours (you become the owner).
* Any other players can join the race until the owner click START, or whether you're 6 runners.
* Everybody engaged in the race receive the same question simultaneously.
* Only the first who sends the good answer makes his pug running one step forward.
* You can only answer once to each question.
